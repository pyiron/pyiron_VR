-periodic system, where you can get new atoms from
-colour the atoms according to their warmth or energy
-make a GUI!
- make a file which tells Unity details about the pyiron structure:
  -> colordependancy, animation
(- delete the code needed for the slower mode of transfering data between Python and Unity)
- let the atoms react live

IMPORTANT:
(- check for bugs)
- bug: false positioning of structure after duplicating and when resizing
(- try to get better performance when having many atoms)
- try to avoid large iterations
- let the animation be interpolated!!!
- Think of a fast way to get the average forces for each atom in Python. Most likely, this should be done when a new ham_lammps is given and not when the force should be send. or maybe it should be done when switching to info mode 
(- ask whether the average force should be the average force in the last 100s or of 50s before and 50s after)
- bring the python program to PEP-8 standard and fix TODOs
- try to set the position of the atoms to 0 when they are at pos 0,0000000001 in Python (or give them in numpy units)
- set the size of MyObjects to 0.3, not the size of the atomStructure
(- implement extracting compressed position data in Unity)
- fix bug that the awake of the lasergrabber is called after the start function of the other scripts 
  -> let the trashcan deactivate itself, instead of letting the lasergrabber do so 
- fix bug that just one controller (the left) can activate both ctrl_printers and that just the left controller can change the modes, but backwards, which happens sometimes if not both controllers are activated at the same time
- set always the same controller to right and left
(- after the structure has been duplicated the whole structure gets moved away one time.)
- bug: false position of the cellbox after it has been moved a bit before the structure has loaded
- implement that the animation can be controlled by the player
- fix bug that sometimes there are error messages "MissingReferenceException: The object of type 'Transform' has been destroyed but you are still trying to access it." after deleting atoms, most likely because the wrong atom has been destroyed
(- check what happens if an controller deactivates itself after not being used for too long (could maybe happen in a presentation))
- continue on calculating
- use this to start the 3D Beamer in the shell: *cd to Desktop* VABuild7_18VRAndBeamer.exe -vrmode Stereo


Seems to be gone:
- found a bug that I couldn't use the laser, after showing the controller printer, until it grabbed the structure
- when having something attached to both controllers the atom in the left hand flickers when moving the structure
- after moving the structure with the laser and the touchpad it sometimes teleports a bit
- fix bug atoms get added each frame (not much known about this bug yet, except that there are many atoms at one place where just one atom should be. might be stretched somehow
