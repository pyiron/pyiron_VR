-periodic system, where you can get new atoms from
-a mode in which you can see of what kind an atom or a structure is
-send commands to pyiron while playing and updating the change
-colour the atoms according to their warmth or energy
-make a GUI!
- make a file which tells Unity details about the pyiron structure:
  -> colordependancy, animation
- connection via the text file has sometimes little problems. If possible, a pipe would be better than this way I think, it might also allow to have more atoms with animation without low fps

IMPORTANT:
(- check for bugs)
- bug: false positioning of structure after duplicating and when resizing
- try to get better performance when having many atoms
- send data received from Python in Unity to ImportStructure
- try to avoid large iterations
- reactivate the ImportStructure script after errors have been solved

Seems to be gone:
- found a bug that I couldn't use the laser, after showing the controller printer, until it grabbed the structure
- when having something attached to both controllers the atom in the left hand flickers when moving the structure
- after moving the structure with the laser and the touchpad it sometimes teleports a bit
- fix bug atoms get added each frame (not much known about this bug yet, except that there are many atoms at one place where just one atom should be. might be stretched somehow
