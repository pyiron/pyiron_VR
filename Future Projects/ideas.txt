-periodic system, where you can get new atoms from
-a mode in which you can see of what kind an atom or a structure is
-send commands to pyiron while playing and updating the change
-colour the atoms according to their warmth or energy
-make a GUI!
- make a file which tells Unity details about the pyiron structure:
  -> colordependancy, animation
- connection via the text file has sometimes little problems. If possible, a pipe would be better than this way I think, it might also allow to have more atoms with animation without low fps
- delete the code needed for the slower mode of transfering data between Python and Unity

IMPORTANT:
(- check for bugs)
- bug: false positioning of structure after duplicating and when resizing
- try to get better performance when having many atoms
- try to avoid large iterations
- let the animation be interpolated
- Think of a fast way to get the average forces for each atom in Python. Most likely, this should be done when a new ham_lammps is given and not when the force should be send. or maybe it should be done when switching to info mode 
- ask whether the average force should be the average force in the last 100s or of 50s before and 50s after
- bring the python program to PEP-8 standard and fix TODOs
- just send the size of the structure if the program begins or if the size changes
- just write something new in the atom/structure info if there is a new text to write (might be faster)
- find bug in Python why it's not possible to do self.duplicate(0.5) (the data doesn't arrive in Unity)
- change the program, so that it can show a static structure again (error in forces, just show forces when it has a lammps/anim) 

Seems to be gone:
- found a bug that I couldn't use the laser, after showing the controller printer, until it grabbed the structure
- when having something attached to both controllers the atom in the left hand flickers when moving the structure
- after moving the structure with the laser and the touchpad it sometimes teleports a bit
- fix bug atoms get added each frame (not much known about this bug yet, except that there are many atoms at one place where just one atom should be. might be stretched somehow
