-periodic system, where you can get new atoms from
-a mode in which you can see of what kind an atom or a structure is
-send commands to pyiron while playing and updating the change
-colour the atoms according to their warmth or energy
-make a GUI!
- make a file which tells Unity details about the pyiron structure:
  -> colordependancy, animation
- connection via the text file has sometimes little problems. If possible, a pipe would be better than this way I think

IMPORTANT:
- show prints while playing
- fix bug atoms get added each frame (not much known about this bug yet, except that there are many atoms at one place where just one atom should be. might be stretched somehow
- if the amount of atoms from the script changes, the atom GameObjects in Unity should in- or decrease
