-periodic system, where you can get new atoms from
-a mode in which you can see of what kind an atom or a structure is
-send commands to pyiron while playing and updating the change
-colour the atoms according to their warmth or energy
-make a GUI

IMPORTANT:
- show prints while playing
- fix bug atoms get added each frame
- connection via the text file is too slow. need a new connection

- build VirtualAtoms (current build isnt working)
