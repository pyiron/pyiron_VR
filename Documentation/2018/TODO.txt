Tasks that can be easily done:
	Change the way "Folders" and "ExecutedJobs" gets shown. At the moment they are useless Buttons. I tried making them 	plain Text, but that doesn't look nice (look yourself by activating these two GameObjects). I think Background should 	be added to the plain Text.

Add more stuff to the menu

Use the System Menu Button to open/close the current menu.

Make the Symbols invisible if the controller is not active ( I don't think that this is worth the time, but the symbols might be confusing).

Let the user rechoose a new job/structure after he has started with a job. Just reload the scene so that it is as it started.
