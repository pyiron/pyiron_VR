Workprogress on Virtual Atoms
by Philip Neugebauer, 1.8.2018 - 30.9.2018

8.9.2018: The program is now working again the same way I left it.

18.8.2018: Optimized the code written in C#. By using static references to a script which gets just deployed once in the scene, these scripts can be referenced easier.

21.8.2018: Finished a testing program for the Python script of Virtual Atoms.

23.8.2018: Updated PyIron to the latest version.

24.8.2018: Wrote the PyIron Script FindStructure which allows to choose an executed Job or a Python File in a Folder and start it with the Sender Script. Unity Support is pending.
